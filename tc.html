The Service and all products and Services delivered to you through the Service are (except as expressly stated by us) provided 'as is' and 'as available' for your use, without any representation, warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including all implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, fitness for a particular purpose, durability, title, and non-infringement. <br>In no case shall Ponni, our directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, interns, suppliers, Service providers or licensors be liable for any injury, loss, claim, or any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages of any kind, including, without limitation lost profits, lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data, replacement costs, or any similar damages, whether based in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, arising from your use of any of the Service or any products procured using the Service, or for any other claim related in any way to your use of the Service or any product, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the Service or any content (or product) posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the Service, even if advised of their possibility. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

                <br><br><strong style="color: #558146;">SECTION 15 - SEVERABILITY</strong> <br>In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions. 
                <br><br><strong style="color: #558146;">SECTION 16 - TERMINATION</strong> <br>The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the termination of this agreement for all purposes. <br>These Terms of Service are effective unless and until terminated by either you or us.

                <br><br><strong style="color: #558146;">SECTION 17 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT</strong> <br>The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. <br>These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by us on this site or in respect to the Service constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service). <br>Any ambiguities in the interpretation of these Terms of Service shall not be construed against the drafting party. 
                <br><br><strong style="color: #558146;">SECTION 18 - GOVERNING LAW</strong> <br>These Terms of Service and any separate agreements whereby we provide you Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India.
